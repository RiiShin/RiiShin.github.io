My name is Lixin Xiu. I'm currently a second-year master candidate at the Department of Mathematical Informatics, the University of Tokyo, and expected to graduate at September 2024. I'm actively finding a Ph.D. position so if you are interested in me, feel free to contact me!

My research topics lie at retrieval techniques (mainly in text-level), semantic representation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). I previously focused on using information-theoretic methods to analyze generative document retrieval quantitively, while my next direction could be related to multimodal applications and retrieval-augmented generation.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
