My name is Lixin Xiu. I'm currently a second-year master candidate at the Department of Mathematical Informatics, the University of Tokyo, and expected to graduate at September 2024. ***I'm actively finding a Ph.D. position*** so if you are interested in me, feel free to contact me!

My research topics lie at retrieval techniques (mainly in text-level), semantic representation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). I previously focused on using information-theoretic methods to analyze generative document retrieval quantitively, while my next direction could be related to multimodal applications and retrieval-augmented generation.
